### Assignment Guidelines
```typescript

class TaskAssignment {
  assignTask(task: Task, team: Developer[]): Developer | null {
    // Filter available developers
    const availableDevelopers = team.filter(dev => 
      dev.isAvailable && 
      dev.skillLevel >= task.requiredSkillLevel
    );

    if (availableDevelopers.length === 0) {
      return null; // Escalate - no available developers
    }

    // Priority-based assignment
    if (task.priority === 'P0' || task.priority === 'P1') {
      return this.assignToMostExperienced(availableDevelopers, task);
    }

    // Load balancing for normal priority tasks
    return this.assignByWorkload(availableDevelopers, task);
  }

  private assignToMostExperienced(developers: Developer[], task: Task): Developer {
    return developers
      .filter(dev => dev.hasExperience(task.category))
      .sort((a, b) => b.experienceLevel - a.experienceLevel)[0] || developers[0];
  }

  private assignByWorkload(developers: Developer[], task: Task): Developer {
    return developers
      .sort((a, b) => a.currentWorkload - b.currentWorkload)[0];
  }
}

// Task estimation guidelines
interface TaskEstimation {
  complexity: 'Simple' | 'Medium' | 'Complex' | 'Epic';
  estimatedHours: number;
  confidence: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
  dependencies: string[];
  risks: string[];
}

function estimateTask(task: Task): TaskEstimation {
  const baseEstimate = {
    'Simple': 4,    // Half day
    'Medium': 16,   // 2 days
    'Complex': 40,  // 1 week
    'Epic': 80,     // 2+ weeks
  };

  let estimate = baseEstimate[task.complexity];
  
  // Adjust for dependencies
  if (task.dependencies.length > 2) {
    estimate *= 1.3;
  }
  
  // Adjust for unknowns
  if (task.hasUnknowns) {
    estimate *= 1.5;
  }
  
  // Adjust for developer experience
  const assignedDev = task.assignedDeveloper;
  if (assignedDev && assignedDev.experienceLevel < 3) {
    estimate *= 1.4;
  }

  return {
    complexity: task.complexity,
    estimatedHours: Math.ceil(estimate),
    confidence: task.hasUnknowns ? 'Low' : 'Medium',
    dependencies: task.dependencies,
    risks: task.identifiedRisks,
  };
}
```

# Supporting branches
feature/*     # New features (branch from develop)
hotfix/*      # Critical fixes (branch from main)
release/*     # Release preparation (branch from develop)

# Example workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user login functionality

- Add login form component
- Implement authentication service
- Add JWT token handling
- Include unit tests for auth flow

Closes #123"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/user-authentication

      throw new Error('Issue not found');
    }

    Object.assign(issue, updates, { updatedAt: new Date() });
    this.checkEscalation(issue);
    
    return issue;
  }

  private checkEscalation(issue: Issue): void {
    const now = new Date();
    const ageInHours = (now.getTime() - issue.createdAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    
    const escalationThresholds = {
      'Critical': 1,  // 1 hour
      'High': 4,      // 4 hours
      'Medium': 24,   // 24 hours
      'Low': 72,      // 72 hours
    };

    const threshold = escalationThresholds[issue.severity];
    
    if (ageInHours > threshold && issue.status === 'Open') {
      this.escalateIssue(issue);
    }
  }

  private escalateIssue(issue: Issue): void {
    issue.escalationLevel++;
    issue.updatedAt = new Date();
    
    // Notify next level
    this.notifyEscalation(issue);
    
    // Log escalation
    console.log(`Issue ${issue.id} escalated to level ${issue.escalationLevel}`);
  }

  private notifyEscalation(issue: Issue): void {
